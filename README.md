# Ppl.py
Repository for the first coding project I ever did on my own (and with the help of online materials). This script came to me when I wanted to see if I could create a very simple search engine using the knowledge I had gained from studying basic Python. I created this script, and I made it so that after a user has provided the program with information on the person they are looking for, the script will open the default browser and then run a search on a few websites (like WhitePages) using the provided values. This was something I created when I had very minimal programming knowledge, but it brings me fond memories and emotions to see where I once was compared to now.
